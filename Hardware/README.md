# Hardware Challenge 2021

Here is a challenge to help you get acquainted with the [JKUAT SES Development board](https://github.com/JKUATSES/sesBoardv1) with the hardware development arena.

### This challenge is due at 1845hr EAT on 11th November, 2021

## Rules

Your submission will be reviewed by the whole JKUAT SES Project members present during the meeting on 11th November 2021. We will consider your experience level when reviewing.

We value quality over completeness. If you decide to leave things out, please call attention to it in your project's `README` .

Our assessment covers the following areas:

*   A functional line following robot
*   Accurate following of a line made from black electrical insulation tape, on a white background.
*   We will also need to hear your approach in achieving the task
*   The line following robot should achieve the following;

    - Follow, autonomously, a black line made from insulation tape.

    - Be able to compensate for areas without the black line. (Small lengths of the line will be left empty - See the provided track)

    - Be able to compensate for random tape in the track. (Random tape will be added - See the provided track)

    - Follow the provided track.


## Functional spec

The robot should work on the demo day.

## Task

Make sure your vehicle includes:

* [ ] The SES Board

* [ ] An IR Sensor array

* [ ] Supporting circuitry

* [ ] Anything that will make your robot follow the track


### Technical spec

Choose any language to build the functionality described in the Tasks that best suits your problem.

#### README

In your repo, please include the following items in your README:

*   Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architecture.
*   Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.

This will give us insight into how you approached the challenge.

### Tips

* Comment your code to show your thought process
